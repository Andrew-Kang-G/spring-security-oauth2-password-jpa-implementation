# POC : Spring Security Oauth2 Password JPA Implementation
## Overview

* In the Spring Security 6 ecosystem, compared to 5, there is a preference for JWT or Keycloak over traditional OAuth2 using a Password Grant method with Spring Security Authorization and Resource Server. I needed to incorporate the current OAuth2 Password Grant with the Spring Security new version and am showing the customization.
  * Set up access & refresh token APIs on both '/oauth2/token' and on our controller layer such as '/api/v1...', both of which function same and have `the same request & response payloads for success and errors`.
    * In the following error payload, the 'message' shouldn't be exposed to clients; instead, the 'userMessage' should be.
      ````
      {
        "timestamp": 1719470948370,
        "message": "Couldn't find the client ID : client_admi",
        "details": "uri=/oauth2/token",
        "userMessage": "Authentication failed. Please check your credentials.",
        "userValidationMessage": null
      }
      ````
  * Authentication management based on a combination of username, client id, and an extra token (referred to in the source code as App-Token, which receives a unique value from the calling devices).
  * Separated UserDetails implementation for Admin and Customer roles.
  * Integration with spring-security-oauth2-authorization-server.
   * Provide MySQL DDL, which consists of oauth\_access\_token, oauth\_refresh\_token and oauth\_client\_details, which is tables in Security 5. As I mean to migrate current security system to Security 6, I haven't changed them to the ``authorization`` table indicated in https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-authorization-server.
  * Application of Spring Rest Docs.
